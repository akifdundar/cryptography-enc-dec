## üåü Project Overview

The Confidential Single-Price Auction is a pioneering auction system leveraging Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine (fhEVM) to enable private and secure token sales. This ensures that bids (e.g., amount, price) remain encrypted while maintaining fairness and transparency in auction resolution.

It is a Hardhat-based project that allows users to deploy a fully confidential auction system on Ethereum testnets such as Sepolia. The system ensures complete bid confidentiality while enabling seamless interaction with smart contracts.

### Current State and Limitations
- Some optimizations are required to enhance efficiency
- A few modules have yet to be optimized for encrypted computation
- Running extensive test suites on a live network may be resource-intensive
- Settlement mechanism ensures fair price discovery by determining the lowest bid required to clear all tokens
- Full encryption is implemented for bids and auction outcomes

## üöÄ Future Roadmap
1. Optimize smart contracts to improve gas efficiency and reduce transaction costs
2. Refine auction logic to handle edge cases more effectively
3. Integrate multi-token support (ERC721, ERC1155)
4. Enable cross-chain functionality with Layer-2 solutions and bridges
5. Strengthen privacy with advanced cryptographic protocols:
   - zk-SNARKs
   - Zero-Knowledge Rollups
   - Improved Homomorphic Encryption
   - Secure multiparty computation (SMPC)

## üéØ Addressing Key Challenges

### Challenge: Unsold Tokens or Insufficient Participation
If an auction does not sell fully, resolution mechanisms include:
- Refunding bidders for unfulfilled allocations
- Executing at the lowest bid price to distribute remaining tokens

### Challenge: Multiple Bidding Attempts
- Enforced one-bid-per-user policy via mapping and bid validation

### Challenge: Bid Modification
- Prohibited bid modifications to ensure fairness

### Challenge: Auction Duration
- Configurable with a minimum duration of 1 hour

### Challenge: Handling Equal Lowest Bids
- First submitted bid at the lowest price is prioritized

### Challenge: Preventing Fake Bids
- Locking mechanism ensures funds are deposited before bid submission

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

### Available Commands
```bash
# List accounts and balances
pnpm hardhat accounts

# Check specific account balance
pnpm hardhat check-balance --account <ADDRESS>

# Get factory information
pnpm hardhat factory-info

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Deploy to network
pnpm hardhat deploy --network sepolia

# Verify contract on Etherscan
pnpm hardhat verify-deployed
```

### Networks
- Hardhat (local)
- Sepolia Testnet
- Zama Network

## How to Use the Confidential Auction

### Setup an Auction
```bash
npx hardhat --network fhevm auction setup --mint 1000 --unpause
# --mint option to distribute tokens to all participants
# --unpause option to activate the auction
# --help to list all available commands
```

### Inspect Deployed Auction
```bash
npx hardhat --network fhevm auction show
```

### Bidding
```bash
# Use auction address
npx hardhat --network fhevm auction bid \
  --auction 0x3Aa5ebB10DC797CAC828524e59A333d0A371443c \
  --user alice \
  --amount 10n

# Resolve auction address automatically
npx hardhat --network fhevm auction bid \
  --user alice \
  --amount 10n
```
